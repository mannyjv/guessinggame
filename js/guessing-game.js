function shuffle(array) {
  //this variable at first will be at the most right point position.Essentially we break up array into an shuffled(front) and unshuffled part, at first the index is all the way at the end but as we add elements from front to back at random, we will decrease this variable by 1, thus moving the index to left, which will decrease the number of elements we still havent shuffled.
  //last index variable is really the last Index in the list of Elements That still need to be shuffled. starting at array.length will ensure that loop runs array.length - 1 times, we bypass 0th index below
  let lastIndex = array.length;

  // While there remain elements to shuffleâ€¦eventually index will reach all the way to the left and be at index 0. Will not go into while loop when index is zero because zero is a falsy value, will bypass index 0, which is why we start with lastINdex being array.length to ensure we shuffle all elements
  while (lastIndex) {
    // Pick a remaining element, between index 0 and what index the lastINdexofElementsToShuffle is at. random number will between those two indexes but will never be the lastIndex itself. Math.random(inclusive,exclusive). this makes sense because for array [1,2,3,4]- array.length is 4, but indexes are 0,1,2,3- math.random will ensure that we will get a index between 0 and 4, which means our last index(3) CAN BE CHOSEN. IT Also reduces it by - 1. But at the time we are running MAth.random to choose a randome index, the lastIndex variable still has the same variable it has at line 22, before it get reduced by - 1. Reducing it by 1 will keep while loop going as lastINdex will move down towards 0, will also help move the randomly selected element to the right place. again for array [1, 2, 3, 4]- for first iteration we choose a random index (0 or 1 or 2 or 3) and later we make sure to place it at the back of  the section of the array that hasnt been shuffled yet at index 3,
    i = Math.floor(Math.random() * lastIndex--);

    // And swap it with the current element by using temporay variable (t) which will hold the elment which is currently at the end of the unshuffled section. array[i] is current element we chose at random. doing this will move the current element to the end of array which is the already shuffled section, already shuffled section will increase as the lastIndex variable is decreased by 1 each iteration
    t = array[lastIndex];
    array[lastIndex] = array[i];
    array[i] = t;
